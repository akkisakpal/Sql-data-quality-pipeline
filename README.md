# SQL Data Quality & Validation Pipeline

## Overview
In real-world analytics and data engineering workflows, raw data often
contains inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and logical errors.
Unchecked data quality issues can lead to incorrect reports and business
decisions.

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to implement robust data
quality checks and validation logic as part of an analytics pipeline.

## Objectives
- Identify common data quality issues in analytical datasets
- Implement SQL-based validation checks
- Demonstrate ETL-style thinking using SQL
- Showcase interview-ready data validation scenarios

## Scope
The project focuses on:
- Schema validation
- Null and range checks
- Duplicate detection
- Referential integrity checks
- Business rule validation

## Status
Project initialized. SQL validation logic will be added incrementally.
